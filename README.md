# FastaTools

This is a simple command line utility to deal with FASTA formatted biological sequence collections, inspired by [goalign](https://github.com/evolbioinfo/goalign) and built in with [bashly](https://bashly.dannyb.co/).

The idea is to have very simple operations _(mainly using `awk`)_ so they can be executed on a per sequence basis, eliminating the need to load the whole file in memory. This allows the user to operate on very large FASTA files.

# Installation

This tool is distributed as a shell script. So if you download the `fastatools` script it should work seamlessly on `*NIX` systems.

# Documentation

For now you can refer to the generated help message by using `fastatools help` or `fastatools [command] help` or the [definition file](./src/bashly.yml).

This is designed to be pipeable, so the default IO is standard input and output. However for all commands the `-i`or `--input` flag can be used to specify an input and for most commands the `-o` or `--output` flag can be used to specify an output flag.

## List of commands

This is a short list presenting the avaiable `fastatools` commands.

### Information commands

- `count`: Get the number of sequences
- `names`: Get names of sequences
- `length`: Get lengths of sequences
- `freqs`: Get character frequencies in sequences

### Selection commands

- `select`: Select sequences in FASTA file by name
- `subset`: Select sequences in FASTA file by index
- `head`: Print first n sequences
- `tail`: Print last n sequences
- `subsite`: Select specific sites in aligned sequences

### Transformation commands

- `upper`: Transform sequences to uppercase
- `lower`: Transform sequences to lowercase
- `pretty`: Pretty print FASTA file, wrapping sequences to desired width

### Name manipulation commands

- ~~`rename`: Rename sequences in FASTA file~~ **(not implemented yet)**
- `addid`: Add an identified to each sequence name in a sequence name

### Splitting commands

- `split`: Split a fasta file into several fasta files

### Others
